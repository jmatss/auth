# Auth
Two-factor authentication application for Android.

## Reasons for creating this application
 - My phone has a small screen (240Ã—432 resolution). I want a compact UI with little bloat, so I don't have to scroll to see all my codes.
 - Current 2FA application I use (_Microsoft Authenticator_) takes ~4 seconds to launch. I would like something more lightweight that launches faster.
 - Seems like an interesting project to work on during my free time. Able to test a new UI framework (Slint), Android development and learn more about how the 2FA process works.
